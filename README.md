# DirectionalData
This is practice for Directional Data Class. 
The .Rmd file is created by Rstudio.
I try different methods to produce some tables, but they looks ugly in .html file and I am not sure how to control them. 
The [.html](https://www.dropbox.com/s/efyhuojs7f1r421/directionalData_html.html?dl=0) which made from .Rmd is too big to display in github.
